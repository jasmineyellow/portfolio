  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>💭 Self Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      As an introverted person, I often find it easier to work independently and focus deeply on my tasks. 
      However, I’ve learned the importance of communication and teamwork, especially in the professional world. 
      I am gradually improving my adaptability to collaborate better with peers, mentors, and future colleagues in the industry. 
      I believe that with consistency and openness, I can build meaningful connections while staying true to my calm and thoughtful nature.
